# **_Tensorflow lab with Keras using the Iris Dataset_**
#### *Emerging Technologies Module - Lecturer: [Ian McLoughlin](ianmcloughlin.github.io) - 4th Year Software Development*
In this lab  [Emerging Technologies](https://github.com/emerging-technologies/emerging-technologies.github.io/blob/master/problems/tensorflow.md), we look at more tensorflow functionality using the iris dataset [Iris Datset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) if you look down below i will show the workings and the instructions how to run the application 

**_For more: [Lab Instructions](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/project.html)_**
**_1: [View Juypter notebook copy](https://github.com/heanuea/Tensorflow/blob/master/TensorflowLab.ipynb)_**
**_2: [View python copy](https://github.com/heanuea/Tensorflow/blob/master/predict.py)_**

## **_Requirements_** 
You will need the following installed to run this project 
* [Anaconda 3.6](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) - The version of python you need 
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) - TO run the ipynb copy of project 
- note if you download Full version of Anaconda Navigator a copy of notebook should be Available 

## **_How to run_** 
First if you go to the right and clone this project and unzip the project to a folder of choice.
```
Cmd in the selected folder (i used git bash )
```
Now you in if You want to Run the script locally just copy this command below. 
```
python predict.py 
```
Ypuu might get error for Keras package so to fix this go into the Anaconda CMD and type..
```
pip install keras 
```
### using Notebook 
now if you need Notebook you will need to run notebook and upload the ipynb file
